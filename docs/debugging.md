# Debugging Issues

You can enable debugging mode with the Debug toggle in the ChromaControl UI.
Once enabled/disabled, a system restart is required. Whilst enabled, this toggle causes a console window to appear when the software is booting up. This window will show you the logs of what is happening... or not happening. You can attempt to figure the problem out on your own, or you can [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/6xGy7cycrt) and there will usually be someone around in the #troubleshooting channel who can help you out.
