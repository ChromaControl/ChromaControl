   - A system restart may be required to ensure it is started properly.
2. Perform the relevant setup steps for the hardware you wish to have enabled (read on for details).
3. Enable the toggles for the hardware you want enabling in the ChromaControl UI
4. Confirm that everything is working by going into Razer Synapse ->  Chroma Connect -> Devices.
