        It's often best not to fill this out until you get basic consensus about the above. When you do, consider adding an implementation proposal with the following headings:

        Detailed design
        Drawbacks
        Considered alternatives
        Open questions
        References

        If there's one clear design you have consensus on, you could do that directly in a PR.
